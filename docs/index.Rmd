```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

### Sourcing Summary Information
```{r}
source("../source/summaryinfo.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The information calculated by our summary information function details change
in cancer patients over the last 20 years, proportion of habitual smokers and or
alcoholics and breast cancer diagnoses, chance of cure based on stage of diagnoses,
correlation of age and breast cancer and proportion of breast cancer cases and deaths.
We also want to calculate if there is a correlation between location and or race
and breast cancer rates.


### Sourcing summary table
```{r}
source("../source/summarytable.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In our table we found that breast cancer rates have stayed relatively constant over the
past 10 years. We also found that there is a positive correlation between habitual smoking
and alcohol abuse and breast cancer. Furthermore, we calculated that most cases detected early
are not lethal, while those detected in later stages are more likely to be lethal. We also found
that most women are diagnosed between 55 and 64 years old, and that the proportion of breast
cancer and deahts have slightly decreased over the past 10 years.


### Sourcing location/race chart
```{r}
source("../source/chart1.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This chart displays the correlation between location of person's residence and their chance
of getting breast cancer, as well as the correlation between a person's race and their 
likelihood of getting breast cancer. We found that white women are the most likely to
develop breast cancer.


### Sourcing marital status
```{r}
source("../source/chart-2.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This table tracks the correlation between marital status and breast cancer
rates. We did not find a strong positive correlation between these two factors, suggesting 
those who are married in one or both of those activities do not have a much higher chance of 
being diagnosed with breast cancer.

```{r}
source("../source/chart_3.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### Sourcing stage chart
This table tracks the correlation between the stage a patient is diagnosed in and
their chance of survival. We found that the earlier someone is diagnosed, the higher
their chance of survival. We found stage 3 to be curable and stage 4 as having 
the highest mortality rate. We also find the when the cancer is regional, which means that the cancer has spread to organs, tissue, or lymph nodes that are nearby, the the death rate is higher.
